        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix</li>
            <li>4 pork chops, trimmed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
                Pour butter into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk together egg, milk, and pepper in a shallow dish. 
                Place stuffing mix in a separate shallow dish. 
                Dip pork chops in egg mixture, then coat with stuffing mix. 
                Lay pork chops in the prepared dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. 
                Flip chops and bake until no longer pink in the center and 
                juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
                inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (74 degrees C).
